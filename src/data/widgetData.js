I mostly taught programming classes in C++. I also worked with seniors to help them develop their semniar projects. I enjoyed my time at Harding, though it was clear to me that teaching was not my passion. My stint as a teacher served as a great way for me to transition out of the Harding world, a world I loved dearly.',

Through this experience, my skills as a programmer grew tremendously as I worked with a range of technologies such as JavaScript, C#, SQL, and more. My favorite part of my internship was the last few weeks: our team had a few developers out, and I had to step up and take on much more responsibility. I rose to the challenge and was able to quickly and efficiently add functionality.',

I did get to meet a lot of interesting and unique people, who helped make the job more bearable.',

It was especially cool to be in Paris in the summer of 2024 as the city was preparing to host the Olympics in a few weeks. While I did enjoy doing some of the staples of a Paris visit, such as seeing the Eiffel Tower and going to the Louvre, these weren\'t the stars. Rather, my favorite part was was visiting Sainte-Chapelle. I was blown away by the beauty of the stained glass that encloses this chapel.' },

We spent time in Madrid, Sevilla, Granada, Barcelona, and some surrounding cities. Being in Spain was incredible as it allowed me to utilize the Spanish I\'d spent 8 years in school learning. The two highlights for me were visitng the cathedral in Toledo and La Sagrada Familia in Barcelona. The beauty and scale of these structures was unbelievable.', reverse: true },

I stood and stared at this wonderful ceiling until my neck hurt. Then I stood and stared some more. ' },
